# Keyword Rank Analysis Report

This report outlines the methodology and findings of the keyword rank analysis conducted in two main phases: initial analysis without removing duplicates and subsequent analysis with duplicate removal and spelling corrections. The objective is to understand the raw and adjusted impacts of keywords within our dataset.

## Phase 1: Analysis Without Removing Duplicates

### Semantic Analysis with Word Vectors

- **Objective:** Utilize average word-to-vector representations for keywords to capture semantic meanings.
- **Method:** Compare keywords using cosine similarity to rank them based on their semantic closeness.

### Sentence Occurrence Count

- **Objective:** Identify sentences in `message.csv` containing any words present in `keyword.csv`.
- **Method:** Count each sentence containing at least one keyword, treating multiple occurrences of the same keyword within a sentence as a single instance.

### Keyword Frequency Table

- **Objective:** Quantify occurrences of each keyword within `message.csv`.
- **Method:** Create a frequency table to analyze the distribution and prevalence of each keyword.

## Phase 2: Analysis with Duplicate Removal

### Removing Duplicate Sentences

- **Objective:** Examine the impact of duplicate sentences on keyword significance.
- **Method:** Identify and eliminate duplicate sentences from the dataset.

### Spelling Correction

- **Objective:** Address spelling variations that may affect keyword detection and frequency counts.
- **Method:** Apply a spelling checker to correct misspellings within the dataset.

### Re-evaluation of Keyword Significance

- **Objective:** Reassess keyword significance post-cleanup.
- **Method:** Repeat the semantic analysis, sentence occurrence count, and frequency table creation with the refined dataset.
- **Comparison:** Evaluate the differences in keyword significance with and without duplicates, including the impacts of semantic analysis and spelling corrections.

## Comparison and Conclusions

- **Findings:** Summarize the key differences observed between the two phases of analysis.
- **Implications:** Discuss the implications of these findings on our understanding of keyword significance and ranking.
- **Recommendations:** Provide recommendations based on the analysis outcomes.
